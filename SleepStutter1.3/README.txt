SleepStutter             version 1.3
====================================
a Max/MSP patch by Ryan Snook (2006)


Information
===========

This is a patch designed to imitate the effect used by Jonny Greenwood on the Radiohead song 'Go To Sleep' (2003). The patch stores incoming audio in a buffer. The buffer is then played back on a rapid loop. The length of audio being looped is periodically randomised within a range set by the user. This all gives a sporadic, stuttering effect.

The patch was designed on Max/MSP 4.5.1 for Windows. Mac compatibility hasn't been tested yet, but it should work.

If you want to put this patch on your own website or whatever, that is of course okay, but please let me know so I can keep track of where it's being distributed.

And of course you may edit this patch and use it in your own code, recordings and projects, but again please just let me know what you're up to, and give me credit where it's due.

Enjoy!
